    "In the previous lesson, we learned the mathematical definition of a gradient.  We saw that the gradient of a function was a combination of our partial derivatives with respect to each variable of that function.  We saw the direction of gradient descent was simply to move in the negative direction of the gradient.  For example, if the direction of ascent of a function is a move up and to the right, the descent is down and to the left. In this lesson we will apply gradient descent to our cost function to see how we can move towards a best fit regression line by changing variables of $m$ and $b$.  "

So in the graph directly below, $x_i$ and $y_i$  would be our points representing a movie's budget and revenue.  Meanwhile, $mx_i + b $ is our predicted $y$ value for a given $x$ value, of a budget. \n",
